# 🌱 Sustainable Crops – Fertilizer Recommendation using Machine Learning for Higher Yield

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on building a **Fertilizer Recommendation System** that helps farmers improve crop yield by suggesting the most suitable fertilizers based on soil and environmental conditions.  
The system uses **Machine Learning models** trained on crop and fertilizer datasets. Additionally, it includes a **Plant Disease Detection module** that uses image processing and deep learning to identify common plant diseases, providing preventive suggestions.  

The main goal of this project is to promote **sustainable farming practices**, reduce excessive fertilizer usage, and increase productivity by offering **data-driven recommendations**.

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ Fertilizer recommendation based on soil nutrients, crop type, and environmental conditions.  
- ✅ Plant disease detection using **Computer Vision (OpenCV + TensorFlow/Keras)**.  
- ✅ Cleaned and preprocessed dataset for better model performance.  
- ✅ Interactive web/app interface (Flask/Streamlit/Django integration optional).  
- ✅ Scalable and adaptable for different crops and regions.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **ML Models**: Classification algorithms (Random Forest, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, etc.)  
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, Git, Streamlit/Flask (for deployment)
